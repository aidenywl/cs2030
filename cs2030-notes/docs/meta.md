**What exactly is a program?**

A program is a set of instructions we issue to computers to manipulate data. A programming language is a formal language that elps programmers specify precisely what are the instructions we issue to computers, using code that are often made up of keywords, symbols, and names.

Instructions are executed by computers in their processing units. The instructions and data are stored in their memory.

A programming language is written at a higher level of abstraction (i.e. at a higher conceptual level).
