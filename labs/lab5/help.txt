Fork Join Task
- Use either Recursive action or recursive task

Recursive ACtion

Submit recursive actions to fork join pool.


left fork then right compute is more efficient than

left fork left join right compute. 
This is because left join will run the asynchronous task before running the compute task.
you can split one thread into many threads then combine them together.

Trying to split it into many cells is not efficient too. Every fork and join has overhead.

You need to decide how many to split them into to make it efficient.
